# AesaraOptimizationAlgorithms
Implementation of iterative optimizers in Aesara. So far I've done Newton's Method. Code for the algorithm was adapted from the Julia code posted by Oscar Veliz at https://github.com/osveliz/numerical-veliz.

More algorithms to come as I find time.

## Newton's Method
Fractal assocaited with the equation:

x ^ 2 - y - 1

x - y ** 2 + 1
